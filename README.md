Organize Images by Year
This Python script organizes images and mp4 files in a specified folder into subfolders based on their creation year. The program checks the creation date of each file, creates folders named 'picture {year}' or 'video {year}' if they do not already exist, and moves the file into the appropriate folders. It handles errors gracefully and provides a summary of the number of images moved and any errors encountered during the process.

Features:

Extracts image and mp4 creation dates from metadata.

Creates year-based folders within the source directory.

Moves the files to the corresponding year folders.

Provides a summary of the process, including counts of files moved and errors encountered.
